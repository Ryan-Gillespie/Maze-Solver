# Maze Solver Program

Made by Ryan Gillespie with the Pygame module.
This program allows the user to draw mazes, or generate one, and then solves them with one of four popular pathfinding algorithms.

## Algorithms used

Fro Pathfinding:

- A*
- Greedy Best First Search
- Depth First Search
- Breadth First Search

For Maze Generation:

- Randomized Prim's Algorithm

## Controls
- r: resets the screen
- c: clears all non barrier nodes from the screen
- space: runs the current pathfinding algorithm on the screen
- enter: Generates a maze and plots it to the screen
- Click: place the start node, then the end node, then any barriers you want to place
- Right Click: delete a given node, sets it to blank
