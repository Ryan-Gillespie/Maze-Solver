# Maze Solver Program

Made by Ryan Gillespie with the Pygame module.
This program allows the user to draw mazes, or generate one, and then solves them with one of four popular pathfinding algorithms.

## Algorithms used

Fro Pathfinding:

- A*
- Greedy Best First Search
- Depth First Search
- Breadth First Search

For Maze Generation:

- Randomized Prim's Algorithm
